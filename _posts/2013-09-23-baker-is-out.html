<p>At the Bakery, we like to ship early and often. We like our web apps just like our croissants - warm and tasty. This pushes us to constantly improve our workflow and optimize it for speed and quality. Adequate tooling is instrumental in achieving these goals. Over the past half a year or so we&#8217;ve been using a set of tools and scripts we&#8217;ve developed to make ourselves more efficient. Today we&#8217;re releasing all of the goodness packaged into a framework we call <a href="http://thebakery.io/baker/">Baker</a>.</p>
<p>Baker is what we use to build powerful web applications that taste great and perform even better. Give it a try and let us know what you think.</p>
