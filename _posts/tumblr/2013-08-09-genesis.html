<p><span>Some feedback on our adventure has been long overdue. It&#8217;s been 2 months since Philip and I left San Francisco. So much has happened since then that it feels like a lot more. It has been an amazing ride and this is how it all started.<br/><br/>6 months ago, </span><span>Philip and I were roommates, both working in San Francisco. We were both somehow frustrated with our day jobs and craving adventure. We both knew it was time for a change and that travel was part of the equation. </span></p>
<p><span>At that time, we started taking on consulting projects with a few local startups. One pay check following the other, we quickly realized this could become a full-time activity. With the help of third friend, we created The Bakery, with the mission statement of building rich web apps with a strong emphasis on design and user-experience. </span></p>
<p><span><span>From the beginning, w</span><span>e wanted to take our business on the road. Our unspoken dream was to travel the world while working with international startups along the way. </span></span><span></span></p>
<p>Around mid-April, we heard about Techpeaks, an accelerator program in Trento, Italy. The idea is to attract talented entrepreneurs from around the world to spend 6 months in the Italian Alps and offer equity-free grants to the most promising projects.</p>
<p><span>We were accepted beginning of May and everything went very fast from there. I submitted a one month notice at work and planned my move to Italy. Within 3 days following </span><span>my last work day, I flew to Paris and drove the 1200km between Paris and Trento. After a few weeks of visa issues, Philip arrived in Trento while our other friend decided to accept a position at a large (and evil) corporation.<br/><br/>A month later, Skilltide was born as gateway for others to do what we are doing: use their skills to travel the world and work with local talent.<br/><br/>One month later, </span><span>we obtained Techpeaks&#8217; 25K euro grant and began building our platform. Meanwhile, we are experimenting with our model, shipping ourselves to various european companies and sharing our skills for hospitality. O</span><span>ur adventures have already taken us to Croatia, and throughout Italy</span><span>.</span><span><br/><br/>In a couple weeks, we&#8217;ll be visiting CicerOOs, an Italian company based in Salento, one of the most beautiful parts of Italy. But more on that in another post&#8230;</span></p>
